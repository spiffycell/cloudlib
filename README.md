This is a prototype library.
Typically, this will be hosted as a standalone repo.
- The repo will adhere to an SSDLC + CICD process
	- Last in the stage is publishing to a registry
		- The services using the library will point to the registry \
			and download the library

Much of the setup and the structure of this and related repos are inspired by the work by [jumanjihouse](https://github.com/jumanjihouse)
